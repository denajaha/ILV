Summary of Tasks and Findings:
###
Linear Interpolation between Slices
###
I have implemented a Python script to perform linear interpolation between two slices of a volume dataset.
The volume dataset was loaded from a compressed numpy file format (npz).
The script allowed for selecting consecutive slices and specifying the number of interpolated slices.
Interpolation weights were computed to span the range [0, 1] and increase linearly.
Linear interpolation was performed pixel-wise along the z-axis.
The interpolated slices were computed using the formula: interpolated_value = (1 - weight) * value_1 + weight * value_2.

###
Interpolation Visualization
###
I have modified the script to visualize the two selected slices to be interpolated and the interpolated slices.
Each slice was displayed in individual figures that opened in full-screen size for easy comparison.
The matplotlib library was used to create the figures and show the slices.

###
Interpolation with Non-Consecutive Slices
###
I have extended the script to interpolate between non-consecutive slices that were further apart.
The interpolated pixel values may not provide accurate estimates for the intermediate intensity values of the volume.
Linear interpolation assumes a linear relationship between slices, which may not hold
for non-consecutive slices that are distant from each other.
Linear interpolation may not capture complex and non-linear variations in the data, leading to less accurate estimates.

###
Interpolation with Two Slices 2 Slices Apart
###
I have modified the script to interpolate between two slices that were 2 slices apart and compared the
reconstructed slice with the ground truth slice.
The interpolated slice was reconstructed by averaging the two neighboring slices.
The mean squared error (MSE) between the interpolated slice and the ground truth slice was computed.
The MSE quantified the difference between the interpolated slice and the ground truth slice, with a lower
value indicating a better estimate.

###
Conclusion:
###
Linear interpolation can provide reasonable estimates when interpolating between consecutive slices in a volume dataset.
 However, when dealing with non-consecutive slices or slices that are further apart, linear interpolation may not
 accurately capture the underlying variations in the data. It is important to consider the nature of the data and
 explore alternative interpolation methods for more accurate results. The comparison with ground truth slices helps to
 assess the quality of the interpolation and identify any discrepancies.

It is crucial to note that the effectiveness of interpolation techniques depends on the specific characteristics of
the dataset and the requirements of the application.
Domain-specific knowledge and more advanced interpolation methods may be required in certain cases.
